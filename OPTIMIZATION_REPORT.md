# GitHub Actions Optimization Report

## Baseline Analysis
- **Original Duration**: ~4 minutes (240 seconds)
- **Current Best**: 3:24 (204 seconds from iteration 4)
- **Improvement**: ~15% - significant optimization potential remains

## New Strategy: Incremental Fine-Tuning
Focus on single changes per iteration with careful measurement and validation.

## Repository Structure Analysis
- **67 total projects**: 36 source, 31 test projects across 27 modules
- **Dependency Levels**: 6 levels of build dependencies
- **Heavy Projects**: Tabler/Blazor with npm builds
- **Test Coverage**: 31 test projects with varying complexity

## Iteration Summaries

### Iterations 1-10: Aggressive Optimization Phase
- **Approach**: Multiple simultaneous changes
- **Issues**: npm build failures, test coverage problems
- **Best Result**: 3:24 (iteration 4)
- **Key Learning**: Too many changes at once caused failures

### Iteration 11: Change Detection Foundation (Failed - npm issue)
- **Change**: Added dorny/paths-filter@v3 for module change detection
- **Purpose**: Track which modules change (logging only)
- **Result**: Failed due to npm ci error (same issue as before)
- **Duration**: 1:39 (99 seconds) - failed early
- **Learning**: Change detection works, npm issue persists

### Iteration 12: Fix npm Install (Failed)
- **Change**: Replace npm ci with npm install to handle missing lock file
- **Result**: Failed - npm build still failing
- **Duration**: 1:47 (107 seconds)
- **Learning**: Simple npm install not sufficient

### Iteration 13: Simplify dotnet restore (Failed)
- **Change**: Remove --locked-mode and --runtime flags from restore
- **Result**: Failed - same npm issue
- **Duration**: ~2 minutes
- **Learning**: Restore optimization didn't help with npm issue

### Iteration 14: Improve npm Handling (In Progress)
- **Change**: Handle both Tabler and Blazor npm projects, conditional ci/install
- **Purpose**: More robust npm dependency management
- **Build**: https://github.com/wangkanai/wangkanai/actions/runs/16387143426

## What Works So Far
1. Parallel tool installation (saves ~5s)
2. NuGet package caching (saves 30-60s when hit)
3. --no-dependencies restore flag
4. Parallel test execution concept (needs refinement)

## What Doesn't Work
1. .NET SDK cache (consistently misses)
2. npm ci without proper lock files
3. Complex test parallelization
4. Too aggressive warning suppressions

## Next Iterations Plan
- **Iteration 12**: Fix npm build properly (use npm install when lock missing)
- **Iteration 13**: Optimize restore with better flags
- **Iteration 14**: Module-specific build caching
- **Iteration 15**: Conditional SonarCloud analysis
